# Specification Quality Checklist: CASL Authorization Library for iOS Swift

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✓ **PASS**: The specification focuses on WHAT the library should do (authorization capabilities) and WHY (enable developers to control access), without prescribing HOW to implement it in Swift.

✓ **PASS**: The specification is written from a developer's perspective (the "user" of this library), describing the value and business needs of authorization.

✓ **PASS**: Language is accessible to product managers and business stakeholders. Technical terms like "Ability" and "conditions" are explained in context.

✓ **PASS**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope & Boundaries) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✓ **PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. The JavaScript library provides a clear reference implementation, eliminating ambiguity.

✓ **PASS**: All 40 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria (e.g., FR-002: "System MUST support checking permissions using can(action, subject, field?) method" can be tested by calling the method and verifying the result).

✓ **PASS**: All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-002: "Permission checks complete in under 1 millisecond", SC-007: "90% of developers can integrate within 2 hours").

✓ **PASS**: Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user outcomes rather than implementation (e.g., "Developers can define permissions in under 50 lines" not "Use protocol X with closure Y").

✓ **PASS**: All 7 user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format.

✓ **PASS**: Edge cases section identifies 10 potential boundary conditions and error scenarios.

✓ **PASS**: Scope & Boundaries clearly defines what's included, excluded, assumptions, dependencies, and technical constraints.

✓ **PASS**: Assumptions section identifies 8 key assumptions about developer knowledge, system state, and operational constraints.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✓ **PASS**: Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (e.g., FR-001 to FR-011 support User Story 1, FR-016 to FR-018 support User Story 2, etc.).

✓ **PASS**: User scenarios cover the complete workflow from basic permission checking (P1) through advanced features like serialization (P3), prioritized by importance.

✓ **PASS**: Success criteria define measurable outcomes for development time (SC-004, SC-005), performance (SC-002, SC-003, SC-006), and adoption (SC-007, SC-009).

✓ **PASS**: The specification maintains abstraction throughout, describing the authorization model without mentioning specific Swift syntax, protocols, or implementation patterns.

## Notes

**ALL ITEMS PASSED** - The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive coverage of CASL's core features from the JavaScript reference implementation
2. Clear prioritization of user stories enabling incremental development
3. Well-defined scope preventing feature creep
4. Strong measurability in success criteria
5. Thorough edge case identification
6. 40 detailed functional requirements providing clear implementation guidance

### Recommendations for Planning Phase
- Consider the Swift-specific challenges identified by the exploration agent (generics, metaprogramming, query matching)
- Plan for performance profiling to meet SC-002 (sub-millisecond permission checks)
- Design API to leverage Swift's type system for compile-time safety (FR-019, FR-020)
- Consider using Swift's Mirror API for property inspection in condition matching
- Plan test strategy to achieve SC-010 (95%+ JavaScript test equivalency)
